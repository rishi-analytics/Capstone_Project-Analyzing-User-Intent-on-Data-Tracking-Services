# Capstone_Project-Analyzing-User-Intent-on-Data-Tracking-Services
Collaborated on a capstone project with Kaleva Media to analyze user behavior intention to use services that process their personal data

# The initial problem with our project:
In our original SEM model using AMOS, the analysis failed to converge because some observed variables (especially related to privacy, information, and security) were loading onto multiple factors, causing confusion in the model structure. To fix this, we used EFA (PCA and PAF) to identify overlapping loadings and introduced three new latent variables — Privacy Understanding, Vulnerability, and Trust in Service Providers — to simplify and stabilize the model.
